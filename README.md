Printf Clone Project
This project is a custom implementation of the popular printf function in the C programming language. The goal of the project is to understand the principles of standard input/output functions and to create our own specialized functions.

Project Description
This project replicates the basic features of the printf function. It supports the following format specifiers:

%d and %i: Prints integers
%c: Prints a single character
%s: Prints strings
%u: Prints unsigned integers
%o: Prints numbers in octal (base-8) format
%x and %X: Prints numbers in hexadecimal (base-16) format
%%: Prints a percent sign
Requirements
Ubuntu 20.04 LTS operating system
GCC compiler with the following options: gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
All files must adhere to the Betty coding style standards.
The use of global variables is prohibited.
A maximum of 5 functions is allowed per file.
